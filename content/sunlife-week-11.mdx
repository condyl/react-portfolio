This week at work was pretty standard.  I spent most of my time working on 
moving the internal tool thoughout the pipeline.  I also helped out with 
some minor defects that were found in the tool.  Honestly, it was a pretty
boring week, but I guess that's just how it goes sometimes.

### Fall 2024 Goals Update

I had a solid week.  Went bouldering Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday.  There was
a competition last weekend, and all the routes were still set, so I had the
chance to try some of the competition routes.  They were all pretty tough,
but I managed to get a few of them.  Was super happy that a bunch of dynos
were set, as I've been working on those a lot lately.

### Personal Life

I also spent a while this week working on my personal website.  I added the 
[Experiments](/experiments) page, which is intended to be a place where I can
make some smaller projects that don't really fit anywhere else.  I added 4 
simple projects to start, and I'm excited to see where it goes from here.

I also spent the weekend helping out with Dylan's bus.  He's made a lot of progress
since I last saw it, and it's starting to look like a real home.  There is now a 
bed platform in the back, and the walls are starting to get framed out.  It's
really cool to see the progress he's made.
