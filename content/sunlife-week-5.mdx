summary: "My fifth week at Sun Life"
---

This week was extremely similar to last week.  I've been attending the daily stand up meetings 
every day, and spending the rest of the day figuring out the tasks I am assigned.  The tasks
have been pretty simple, and after a quick 10 minute call with a team member or a couple messages
back and forth, I have been able to do them quite quickly.  I only had problems with one task,
which was basically just formatting a payload to be sent to a service.  I was able to do it 
quite easily, I just didn't exactly know what the payload was supposed to look like, and what
URL it was supposed to be sent to.  It was more of a communications issue than a technical one,
though I guess it's just part of the learning curve at a larger company.  Never really going to
know everything about their entire code base off the bat, lol.

Other than that, I attended the CI (Continous Integration) Challenge Kick Off meeting.  The CI 
Challenge is a group project type thing hosted by the campus recruiting team.  Basically, anyone
(exclusive to co-op students) who registers is put on a team, and that team has to think of an idea
that will improve *something* at Sun Life.  We then have to take our idea and present it to a board
of exectutives.  It's also a challenge, so there can be an overall winner and a sustainability 
winner.  We had a chance to meet our team members, and had a very short brainstorming session about what 
we could do.  I was put on a team with [Ervin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ervinung/), who I met
during the Waterloo orientation.  It's nice to have someone on the team that I've met before, and
I think we will work well together.  We have a meeting scheduled for next week to discuss our idea
further.

### Fall 2024 Goals Update

This week has been *much* better than last week.  I went bouldering 4 times, and went swimming
once.  I'm not sure if I will be going to the gym much for the rest of the term, as I've never
really enjoyed it over climbing or swimming.  I'll probably still go the odd time, but I don't
think I'll be going as much as I originally planned.  I also didn't get the chance to work on 
the bus control panel, which isn't a huge deal considering the bus *just* finished getting 
gutted.  There's still lots of time before we need to start working on the control panel, so
I'm not too worried about it.

### Personal Life Update

It was me and my girlfriend's 2 year anniversary this week.  We went out for dinner at this 
boujee restaurant, [Lake House](https://lakehouserestaurant.com/).  You can see our [Instagram 
post](https://www.instagram.com/p/DApcvv8ROmVsfVrYe-sescdQkatH3ooU9YSfZw0/?img_index=1) there.  It
was a great time, and the food was amazing.  I'm very happy to have her in my life, and I'm
excited to see what the future holds for us.  She also ordered a $9 bottle of water by accident, lol.
