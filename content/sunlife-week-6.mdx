summary: "My sixth week at Sun Life"
---

At this point in the term, I am comfortably settled in at Sun Life.  I am 
being assigned tasks as they come up, and I am able to complete them without
much trouble.  It has been very nice to be able to work on tasks without
having to ask for help every 5 minutes (though, I've been doing more Javascript
work than AEM related stuff, so that's definitely a factor).  

There hasn't been much to report on this week other than that.  It's been 
a straightforward, standard week, without much notable things happening.  

I attended a GitHub Copilot workshop on Tuesday, which would have been entirely
game changing if I wasn't already familiar with the tool and using it 
regularly.  I also attended the CI Challenge team meeting, where we discussed 
some possible ideas.  We don't have anything concrete yet, but a couple 
solid ideas have been thrown around. 

The campus recruiting team also hosted a Resume Building workshop, which 
I attended (while flipping back and forth with another meeting, haha). I 
would encourage anyone who is applying for jobs to attend these types of 
workshops, as it is helpful to hear what is good from the people who are actually
looking at your resume.  At the end there was a short "spot the issue" game,
which I felt very confident at (which comes at no surprise, considering I 
spend a bit too much time looking at resumes & feedback in the [cscareers.dev](https://discord.gg/cscareers)
and [CSMajors](https://discord.gg/csmajors) discord servers).  Felt like a
celebrity getting 24 "ðŸ˜‚" reactions on a message, lol.

### Fall 2024 Goals Update

I'm locked in again and it feels good.  Went bouldering 5 times, and swimming
once. I've ignored the gym, and have pretty much decided that I won't going
or worrying about it anymore.  

### Personal Life Update

Me and Ruby (girlfriend!) have started going to the drop-in badminton sessions
at Brock.  We got some rackets and birdies on prime day, and went twice this
week.  Despite being absolutely horrible at it, it's been fun and I think this
should be another good way to stay active.  Next week is reading week for current
Brock students, so I am hoping that the courts will be less busy and we can
get some more games in.

Another exciting thing that happened this week was being able to see the aurora,
and get pictures for the first time!  On Wednesday night (October 10th), me and
Ruby went to a nearby park to try and see the aurora.  It unfortunately wasn't 
visible to the naked eye, but I was able to get some pictures of it using a
long exposure on my camera.

I also spent my Saturday helping Dylan (my brother) with his bus.  We were
working on finishing up the sealing process and patching up all the screw 
holes in the floor.  You can see some of his updates on his 
[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dylans.discoveries/).

Quite the surprisingly lengthy update this week, lol.  Have a happy Thanksgiving!
