The week was also pretty standard.  I spent most of my time working on moving 
the internal tool thoughout the pipeline.  Unfortunately, on Friday, my team 
and I had a knowledge transfer meeting with the team that will be taking over
the tool.  They brought up a couple of issues that we hadn't thought of, so
we'll have to delay the release until January (after I'm finished my co-op).

That means that my week of getting PR's approved and trying to deploy to the
various environments was all for nothing.  It's a bit frustrating, but all of 
the issues they brought up were valid, so I can't be too upset.  Should have
thought of them myself, ðŸ¤·.

Other than that, I went in person to the Waterloo office to meet with my CI 
team and make some progress.  At this point, we are pretty far behind considering
the presentation is in less than 2 weeks.  I'm not too worried, but it's going
to be a busy couple of weeks.  Also, the Waterloo Student Social Committee at 
Sun Life hosted a co-op student dinner at a local restaurant.  It was nice to
meet some of the other students and chat about our experiences.

### Fall 2024 Goals Update

During the week, I didn't have much time to do anything other than work.  I
did manage to go bouldering on Sunday, and Saturday, but that was about it.
