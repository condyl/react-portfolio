I had a chance to participate in Sun Life's Elevate Cloud Tech Hackathon this week.  The
5-day event completely took over my week, so I wasn't doing
much *actual* work.  I was fortunately able to team up with CI Challenge teammate
and fellow co-op student [Rishad Luthra](https://linkedin.com/in/rishadluthra/),
and some of his full time team members [Alex Wu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexshwu/) and
[Mahir Khandaker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mahir-khandaker/).  They were
absolutely amazing and I could not have wished for a better team.

### Day 1 (Monday)

On Monday, I had the chance to go into the Toronto York office for the event's 
kick-off.  [Alex](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexshwu/), and [Mahir](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mahir-khandaker/)
and I were able to meet up in person while [Rishad](https://linkedin.com/in/rishadluthra/) joined us
virtually.  It generally covered the rules of the hackathon, the judging criteria,
what AWS services & other tools we could use, and some general tips for success.  There
was also a special guest panel with a bunch of Sun Life AVPs and Directors, which was
pretty cool.

After the kick-off and the catered lunch (which was amazing), we decided to attend the 
AWS skill builder workshop.  It was very inspiring in terms of how to come up with good ideas,
however I wish there was more technical content.  I was hoping for a bit more of a deep dive 
into some of the services that we could use, but I guess that's what the AWS & technical 
office hours were for.

After the workshop, we met with our mentor Mihai Csaki, who was absolutely amazing and 
extremely knowledgeable.  He was able to help us come up with a solid idea, and gave us some
good tips on how to structure our project.  We decided that we would make an Amazon Q 
AI-powered chatbot, integrated with tools frequently used at Sun Life, such as Confluence, Jira, and 
ServiceNow.  

### Day 2 (Tuesday)

We spent the remainder of the week working virtually.  The day started off with us creating
a mockup of what a Sun Life Confluence page would look like, adding information that was 
realistic but not real.  We then worked on connecting Amazon Q to our new Confluence page,
and letting it train on the data.  The rest of the day was spent debugging and trying to
get the chatbot to work properly.

Alex ended up having a breakthrough at around 6pm, and was able to get the chatbot working.

### Day 3 (Wednesday)

After hearing the good news from Alex, we trained a new Amazon Q instance on a separate 
(mock) Confluence page (to demonstrate that it could be trained on any page, and only knows
information from what it's trained on).  We were also able to integrate the chatbots directly
into Confluence, using an iframe.  The team also trained the chatbot on some developer 
documentation, and were able to get it to answer some basic questions.

### Day 4 (Thursday)

We spent all day working on the presentation.  We created a slide deck, recorded a demonstration
video, and practiced our pitch.  We also had a meeting with our mentor to go over the presentation,
and get some feedback.  He was very impressed, and gave us some good tips on how to improve
it.  The presentation had to be extremely short (5 minutes *maximum*), so we had to make sure
that we were able to get our point across quickly and effectively.  I ended up re-recording the 
demonstration video about 15 times, as I kept messing up my lines, while also trying to ask
5 questions to the chatbot in under 1 minute.  We ended up practicing our pitch about 10 times,
and I think we were all very confident in it by the end.

### Day 5 (Friday)

The day of the presentation!  We had to present to a panel of judges, which included some of the
AVPs and Directors that were at the kick-off.  We were pretty late in the queue, so we ended up 
having to wait for about 2 hours before we were able to present.  The presentation went extremely
well, and we were able to get our point across in under 5 minutes.  It was impossible to tell
if the judges were impressed or not, as they had their cameras off and were muted the entire time.

The presentations ended up taking a lot longer than expected, so we had to wait for about 3 hours 
before the winners were announced.  At best, I was hoping to get at least top 3, as there were 
some really good projects that were presented.  I was extremely surprised when they announced that
we had won the hackathon!  I was not expecting it at all, and was extremely happy.

It was a great way to end the week, and I was extremely happy with how everything went.  I was
also very happy to have met and worked with Alex, Mahir, and Rishad.  They were all extremely
knowledgeable and great to work with.  I hope that we can work together again in the future.

Considering that I potentially wasn't going to be participating in the hackathon at all, I am
extremely happy with how everything turned out.  I was able to learn a lot about AWS services,
and how to structure a project.

### Fall 2024 Goals Update

I only ended up going bouldering once this week.  Earlier in the week, I sliced my thumb open 
and didn't want to risk getting it infected.  I also didn't go swimming or to the gym at all.
