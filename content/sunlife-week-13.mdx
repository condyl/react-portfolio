summary: "My thirteenth week at Sun Life"
---

This week has been quite stressful with the upcoming CI Challenge due date.  I
pretty much spent the entire week working on the presentation, as well as the 
demo that we will be presenting to the judges.  Our idea is pretty solid, but
we are having some troubles the cost savings that we are claiming.  We are
currently working on a way to prove that our solution will save the company
money, but it's been a bit of a struggle.

I also spent some time working on the internal tool, as we are still planning
on releasing it in January.  Basically all of my time was spent on the CI
Challenge, but I did manage to make a few commits to the tool. 

Beat The Boss: Ping Pong edition was this week, and was lots of fun.  I didn't 
even end up playing, but it was fun to watch.  I spent most of the time chatting
with some of the other students, and watching the games.

### Fall 2024 Goals Update

I only ended up bouldering once this week, on Tuesday.  I was super busy helping 
Ruby study for her exams, and was sick for the last half of the week. 

### Personal Life

Outside of work, I started a new project!  I'm building a pretty simple resume
builder that allows for nice [Jakes Resume](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs)
style resumes, without the struggles of learning and using LaTeX.  I'm building 
it with React, Next.js, and Express, and it's been a lot of fun so far.  There 
is currently a [live version](https://resume-creator-frontend.vercel.app/) that 
you can check out, but it's still very much a work in progress. Beware that it 
does not play nice with mobile yet. 

Realistically, I'm mostly just building it for fun, and not because I struggle 
with LaTeX (especially since I'm just editing content in a template lol).  I plan 
on adding some more features, like accounts and saving resumes, but we'll see how
far I get.  So far, I've got the basic functionality working, and I'm pretty happy
with it.  I've also played around with the OpenAI api, so there is a button that
will rewrite (and hopefully improve) a specific dot jot of your resume.  

If you're interested in checking out the code, it's available on GitHub now.  It's 
separated into two repositories, one for the [frontend](https://github.com/condyl/resume-creator-frontend), 
and one for the [backend](https://github.com/condyl/resume-creator-backend).  I'm
using GitHub Actions to deploy the frontend to Vercel, and manually deploying the
backend to a DigitalOcean droplet.
