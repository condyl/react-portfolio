> Wow, this week was honestly pretty brutal.

This was me last week.  I spent the entire week trying to figure out how to do a simple task
in AEM, but wasn't able to do it in the end.  This week, I spent 1 hour messaging a team member
and 2 hours actually doing the task.  It made me realise why people say "just ask for help",
because it really does save a lot of time.  I was able to finish the task, and I'm pretty happy
with the result.  I showed my manager & a couple other team members, and it is exactly what they
were expecting.  I made a couple of final changes, wrote some documentation, and then submitted 
my first PR of the term.  It was submitted late on Friday, so it should be reviewed some time next
week.

Since the start of the term, I've been constantly worried and stressed that I was taking too long
to do X or Y, but every time I've also been told that I am speeding through things and picking 
everything up very quickly.  I'm not sure if I'm just being too hard on myself, or if I'm just
not used to the pace of a full-time job.  

Apart from that, I've officially been added to my squad.  I'm now a part of the "MarTech Elite
Squad" at Sun Life.  I still don't exactly know what they're working on currently, but I'm excited
to be a part of it.  I was also able to attend my first daily stand up meeting, which was alright
considering I had no idea what anyone was talking about.  

Also, I was able to attend the first Sun Life "Beat The Boss" event of the term.  It was a fun
TV/movie trivia game which I came 9th out of around 60 people.  I was pretty happy with that, as
I don't really watch TV or movies that much.  There was also a lot of networking time with a bunch
of managers, directors, and exectutives, which was pretty cool.  I also got the chance to see a 
couple of my friends from the first day of orientation, which was nice.

### Fall 2024 Goals Update

I've fallen off completely.  I went bouldering twice this week, but didn't swim or go to the gym
once.  I also started working on a bit of a template for the bus control panel project, but I think
we've decided to use HomeAssistant instead.  I think I will still be using the Raspberry Pi as a 
security camera system, but may find another solutions for that as well.  I'm not sure yet.

Me being lazy this week isn't completely my fault though.  Last Sunday (the 22nd), I went back out
to the bus to help Dylan with some more work.  We were only there for an hour-ish, so all we did 
was remove a couple of roof panels and talk about his plans for the bus.  Before we left, I started
closing all the windows because it was supposed to rain that night.  I was able to close all of them
except for the one above behind the driver's seat.  I pushed the latches in, the window dropped 
instantly, crushing my fingers between the window latch and a large sheet of old subflooring that was 
leaning against the wall.  I got a couple of deep cuts on my fingers and some bruising.  So anyways,
I didn't feel like going into a chlorine pool with open cuts on my fingers, so I didn't swim.  

I have no excuse for not going to the gym though.  I just didn't feel like it.  lol.

It wasn't all bad though!  Even though I only went bouldering twice, I was able to send my second ever
V5 problem.  It was a fight to the top, but I was able to get it.  I got exausted very quickly, so my 
sessions were pretty short.  I'm hoping to get back into the swing of things next week.

Also!  I've also added another blog post which I briefly mentioned last week.  I added a post about
[Packing: How it was made](/blog/packing), which is a post about the process of making the Packing 
three.js project, with progress photos and some behind the scenes stuff.  Check it out if you're
interested!

That's all for this week.  Have a good rest of your day!  ðŸš€
