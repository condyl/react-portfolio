Two months in already!  

Last week was also pretty slow for me.  I spent a lot of time working on the CI
Challenge with my team, but other than that, there wasn't much for me to do.  The
only real problem I've had at Sun Life so far is that there doesn't seem to be 
enough work for me to actually do.  I made the improvements to the internal tool
that I was assigned, and hope to deploy it some time in the coming week.

> I recieved a couple of OA's from companies that I would like to do well on (Uber, Cisco).

I completed the OA's for both Uber and Cisco this week.  I did very well on the 
Cisco one (only one test case missed out of the 3 questions), but absolutely tanked
the Uber one (got stuck on the third question, ended with a 404/600).  Disappointing,
but can't really get too upset about it considering I had only spent less than a week
preparing for them.  I'm hoping that I will be able to get an interview with Cisco
at least, as I think I did well enough to get one.  I already know that I won't be 
getting one from Uber, but I am happy nonetheless that I was able to get past the 
first round (though I know that *many* people recieved it).

Moving on, I also recieved an OA from Snowflake this week.  Apparently it's very
hard so I don't think I will be able to do well on it, but we will see.

### Fall 2024 Goals Update

It was a pretty slow week this week.  I only ended up going bouldering twice,
and didn't swim or go to the gym at all.  I spent a couple nights helping Ruby
study for her midterms, so that took priority over swimming and the gym.  We
will definitely be going swimming again next week.

### Personal Life Update

On Sunday night, I went with a couple friends to Halloween Haunt at 
[Canada's Wonderland](https://www.canadaswonderland.com/).  We all got fast passes,
so we were able to go on all the rides and mazes that we wanted to (though, even with 
the fast passes, there were still some pretty long lines compared to last year).  The 
second ride we went on was the Leviathan, which was exciting as always.  Maybe we
should have saved it for later in the night, and had a little bit of a warm up with some
of the smaller rides, lol.
