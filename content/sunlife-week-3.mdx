summary: "My third week at Sun Life"
---

Wow, this week was honestly pretty brutal.  Not because I was super stressed or super busy
or anything, but because I was just so bored.  I spent the start of the week trying to 
figure out some stuff in AEM, but after not being able to figure it out I really had no 
idea what to do.  Both my mentor and manager were out of the office for the week, so I 
ended up doing random stuff that I thought might be useful.  

I ended up just reading through some of the AEM documentation, but I didn't really
understand much of it.  I also completed a couple of courses provided by Sun Life, but 
they weren't really related to the project I was working on.  Some were somewhat related to what I could be working on
in the near future, and some were more personal interests.  Some of the tech I learned about was:

- React
- Java 
- AWS Lambda
- AWS Bedrock

That was pretty much my entire work week.  Not much happened, which is quite disappointing,
but hopefully I can get some more help next week.  I've been kind of beating myself up over
not being able to figure out the AEM stuff myself, and I hope it doesn't affect my manager's 
perspective of me too much.  

### Fall 2024 Goals Update

I haven't really been doing much towards my goals.  I've been bouldering a couple times
this week, but much less than usual (only 2 times).  I went swimming with my girlfriend on
Tuesday and Thursday, but didn't go to the gym at all.  A bit disappointed in myself, but
I'm sure I can get back on track next week.

On a brighter note,  I was able to start remembering the basics to using a Raspberry Pi.  I 
haven't used one since high school, but I was able to get it up and running with some basic 
sensors and some Python code.  I think I may have an idea for a pretty cool project that 
will be actually used, but I'll have to discuss it with my brother first.  I'll mention it 
more in next week's post if it goes anywhere.  It should be pretty cool.

### Personal Life

Once again, I'm back to playing video games.  I spent many hours playing Valorant this week,
which has been very fun.  I've enjoyed playing games all my life, so it has been nice to have
the time to play them again.

My brother Dylan also picked up his soon-to-be home on wheels,  a 2012 GMC school bus. He's
working on renovating it into a tiny home, and I'm super excited to see how it turns out.  I
went to see it on Saturday, and was immediately put to work on removing the flooring.  It was
a lot of fun (and also very tiring, considering it was 27C outside and even hotter inside the 
bus), and I'm excited to help him out more in the future.

The end goal is to have a fully functional tiny home on wheels, with a bed, kitchen, bathroom,
and anything else, then use it to travel across Canada.  He has started an Instagram page, 
[@dylans.discoveries](https://www.instagram.com/dylans.discoveries/), to document the entire
process.  I would take a look if you're interested in that kind of stuff.

Since he picked up the bus, I've been on a YouTube rabbit hole of tiny home and van life
videos.  It's always seemed like a super cool idea to me, despite the fact that I don't 
think I would be able to do it myself.  Seeing peoples solutions to problems that I never
even thought of is super interesting.  I hope to be able to go on a trip with him once it's
all done, but we'll see how that goes.

The project mentioned above is to create a all-in-one control panel for the bus.  I've mentioned
it to Dylan before, and it seems like he is interested in it.  I want to start working on it
now, but I really don't have any idea how or what Dylan is going to have in the bus.  I think
it would be cool to host a web server on the Raspberry Pi, and have a touch screen display
in the bus that can control everything.  I'm not sure if he plans on having security cameras
or anything like that, but I think it would be cool to have a live feed of the cameras on his 
phone whenever needed.  As mentioned earlier, I will need to talk to him to find out exactly
what he wants/needs.

See you next week :D
