This week was super exciting.  We had our CI Challenge presentation on 
Wednesday, which ment we had a lot of work to do leading up to it.  We 
spent multiple hours on both Monday and Tuesday working on the presentation,
and the demo that we would be showing to the judges.  I honestly had an
amazing time working with my team, and I think we did a great job.   

Even with all this time spent on the presentation, we still managed to
still have changes to make on Wednesday morning.  We were all super nervous
going into the presentation, but it ended up going really well.  Our 
presentation went smoothly, and our timing was perfect.  We were able to 
answer all of the judges questions (maybe a bit too much answering), and 
I think we did a great job of showing off our solution.  We unfortunately
didn't win, but I'm still super proud of what we accomplished.

Even though the CI Challenge was happening in-person in the Toronto office,
I went to the Waterloo office on the day of.  Our team had a remote presentation,
and I had to go to Waterloo to pick up my free Sun Life swag.  I also was 
able to meet up with [Ava](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ava-schenk-a87551239/)
and Diya to watch the rest of the presentations.  It was nice to see some
of the other teams and what they had come up with.  We also went to get lunch
from the office cafeteria, which was suprisingly really good.

On Thursday,  I went to the Toronto office to attend the 2024 Sun Life 
Holiday Celebration.  It was a really fun event, with a lot of food and
drinks.  I hung out with a bunch of the other interns, and we had a great
time.  I also had the chance to meet most of my squad in person, which was 
really cool (and suprising!  I wasn't expecting them to be there).  The office
was the most packed I've ever seen it.  Me and my squad didn't exactly spend a
ton of time working, and instead just hung out and chatted for most of the day.

Friday was a pretty chill day.  I spent most of the day working on the 
internal tool, and then chilled out for the rest of the day. 

### Fall 2024 Goals Update
I only went bouldering once this week.  Not much else to add.
