I went to the office again!  It's been over a month since I last worked in person,
so it was nice to see some actual people again haha.  I was able to meet one of my 
CI Challenge teammates in person, which was cool.  We had a good chat about the
challenge and some other stuff.  I also got to see some of the other interns that I 
hadn't seen in a while, which was also nice.  

Back to the reason I was in the office: Beat The Boss (Halloween Edition).  We had a 
good networking session with some of the higher-ups at Sun Life, and then had an 
intense haunted house making competition.  Me and my teammate Diya ended up losing 
(not even finishing before we ran out of time), but it was still a good time.  Below
is a picture of the winning team's haunted house (they apparently finished with 10 
minutes left, somehow!):

I've also made more progress with my internal tool.  I've made some more adjustments
to the UI, because I noticed some defects after deploying and testing on the dev 
environment.  I should be able to deploy it further this week, then get it tested
and deployed to prod during the next release.  

I also had my mid-term check-in with the Brock co-op office, where they basically just
asked me a bunch of questions about how my term has been going.  They then went and 
talked to my manager separately, and then gave me some of the feedback that they
received.  Apparently he "only had positive things to say about me", which feels 
great.  I'm glad that I am doing well at Sun Life, and that my manager is happy with
my work.

Despite that, there is always that tinge of imposter syndrome that doesn't seem to go 
away.

Next week is the internal hackathon I mentioned last week.  I'm going in person again
on Monday to attend the kick-off event and opening ceremonies, as well as meet my team 
in person.  It's a cloud-based (AWS) hackathon, so I hope to learn a ton from it (
especially considering I have no experience with AWS).  It should be a very exciting 
week, and I can't wait to see what we come up with.

### Fall 2024 Goals Update

I only ended up going bouldering twice this week.  I was very tired after work and 
had a pretty lazy week in general (at least, once I was done with work).
